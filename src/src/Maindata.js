            'Hiking, the activity of walking for extended periods of time in natural environments, has been an integral part of human history for centuries. The first documented hikers were likely early explorers and hunters who traveled on foot in search of food and resources. In the 18th and 19th centuries, hiking became a popular leisure activity among the upper classes in Europe, who would venture into the mountains to enjoy the beauty of nature and the challenge of climbing.
